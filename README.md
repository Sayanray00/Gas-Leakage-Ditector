# Gas-Leakage-Ditector
The Gas Leakage Detector project is designed to address the critical need for reliable detection and alert systems in environments where gas leaks pose significant risks to safety and health. The system employs an analog gas sensor interfaced with a microcontroller to continuously monitor gas concentration levels.
